# Finsrud Frukt static fruit store

This repository contains a simple, multi‚Äëlingual fruit shop for small‚Äëscale farmers.  Customers can browse your current fruit inventory, add items to a shopping cart, review their basket, enter their name and an optional message, and place an order.  After checking out, the site displays a Vipps QR code for payment and sends you an order email via [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/).  Everything runs client‚Äëside, so there‚Äôs no need for an expensive app service or Azure Functions.  Host it on any static web host (Azure Storage, GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.) and use Cloudflare to handle your custom domain and TLS.

## Customising products and cart behaviour

Products are defined in the JSON file under `data/products.json`.  Each entry contains the following fields:

```json
{
  "id": "plum-opal",        // unique identifier
  "category": "plum",        // category (plum or apple)
  "name": "Plum",            // display name
  "variety": "Opal",         // variety name
  "price": 50,                // price per kilogram in NOK
  "images": ["https://example.com/plum1.jpg", "https://example.com/plum2.jpg"] // image URLs
}
```

To add a new product or variety simply append a new object to this file.  Each product can optionally include a boolean `comingSoon` flag and the shop will display it as ‚ÄúKommer snart / Coming soon‚Äù instead of letting customers select a quantity.  When you redeploy the static website, it will automatically pick up any additions.  You can list multiple images for each product by adding image URLs to the `images` array.  A small image shows on the card, and clicking a product opens a gallery with all images and the description.

Customers add items to a cart by entering the desired kilograms and clicking **Add to Cart**.  The **View Cart** button shows how many items are in the basket.  In the cart view, customers can verify the order, see the running total, fill in their name (required), phone and message (both optional) and then submit the order.  After checkout the cart is cleared.

If you would like to send customers a confirmation email, there is also an **Email** field on the checkout form.  When the customer enters an address, the site uses a second EmailJS template (configured in `script.js` via `EMAILJS_CONFIRM_TEMPLATE_ID`) to send a copy of the order to that address.  If no email is provided, no confirmation is sent.  Your own email (configured in the main template) will always receive the order notification.

## Deploying the static website and configuring your domain

1. **Create a storage account** (or use any static hosting service).  The storage account should be of the `StorageV2` type (LRS) and located close to you.

2. **Enable the static website feature** in the Azure Portal under *Static Website*.  Use `index.html` as the index document and leave the error document blank or set it to `index.html` if you want a single‚Äëpage experience.

3. **Upload the site files** (everything in the root of `frukt_site` except the `function_app` folder) into the `$web` container of the storage account.  You can use Azure Storage Explorer, the Azure Portal upload tool or `az storage blob upload-batch`.

4. **Point your custom domain to the static site via Cloudflare**.  Since Azure CDN (classic) with custom domains is being decommissioned, a simple alternative is to delegate your DNS to Cloudflare.  In your domain registrar (e.g. Domeneshop), change the nameservers to the ones provided by Cloudflare.  Then, in Cloudflare‚Äôs DNS tab, create a CNAME record:

   | Name | Target | Proxy |
   |------|--------|-------|
   | `frukt` | `<your-storage-account>.z6.web.core.windows.net` | Proxied |

   Replace `<your-storage-account>` with the name of your Azure storage account and adjust the region identifier (`z6`) if necessary.  Once the CNAME is in place, Cloudflare will proxy requests for `frukt.finsrud.cloud` to your static site.

5. **Enable HTTPS and caching** in Cloudflare.  Under the **SSL/TLS** tab choose **Full** mode, enable **Always Use HTTPS** and **Automatic HTTPS Rewrites**.  You can optionally create a page rule to cache everything for faster performance.  Since Azure CDN (classic) with custom domains is being phased out, this approach using Cloudflare is simpler and cheaper for small projects.

Your visitors will now be able to access the site via `https://frukt.finsrud.cloud` served through Cloudflare.

## Configuring EmailJS for order notifications

This project uses [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) to send order notifications directly from the browser.  Follow these steps to configure it:

1. **Create an EmailJS account** at [https://www.emailjs.com](https://www.emailjs.com) and sign in.

2. **Add an email service** (e.g. Gmail, Outlook or EmailJS SMTP) in the **Email Services** section.  Follow the prompts to authenticate the service.

3. **Create an email template** under **Email Templates**.  If you would like a bilingual notification, use a subject such as:

   ```
   New fruit order / Ny fruktbestilling ‚Äì Finsrud Frukt
   ```

   And paste the following HTML into the template‚Äôs HTML tab (you may customise colours and wording).  This template includes your logo at the top, customer name, phone and optional message, a list of the ordered items and the total in both Norwegian and English:

   ```html
   <div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; max-width: 600px; margin: auto;">
     <div style="text-align: center; padding: 20px;">
       <img src="https://finsrudfrukt.z6.web.core.windows.net/images/logo.png" alt="Finsrud Frukt" style="max-height: 80px;">
       <h2>Fruktbestilling / Fruit Order</h2>
     </div>
     <div style="padding: 20px; background-color: #f9f9f9; border-radius: 8px;">
       <p><strong>üë§ Navn / Name:</strong> {{name}}</p>
       <p><strong>üìû Telefon / Phone:</strong> {{phone}}</p>
       {{#note}}<p><strong>üìù Melding / Message:</strong> {{note}}</p>{{/note}}
       <p><strong>üì¶ Ordrelinjer / Order Details:</strong><br>{{order}}</p>
       <p><strong>üí∞ Totalt / Total: {{total}} NOK</strong></p>
       <p>Du vil motta betaling via Vipps. Vennligst sjekk appen din.<br>You will receive a payment via Vipps. Please check your app.</p>
       <p>Takk for bestillingen!<br>Thank you for your order!</p>
     </div>
   </div>
   ```

   The `{{name}}`, `{{phone}}`, `{{note}}`, `{{order}}` and `{{total}}` placeholders are filled in by the website when the customer submits the cart.  You can adjust the template or add your own fields as long as the names match the `input` names in the hidden form (`orderForm`).

4. **Collect your keys**.  In the **Integration** tab, take note of the **Service ID**, **Template ID** and **Public Key**.  Open `script.js` and replace the `EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID`, `EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID` and `EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY` constants with your values.

5. **Publish the site**.  Upload the updated files to your storage account.  When a user submits an order, the site will populate a hidden form and call `emailjs.sendForm()` to send you an email.

### Sending a confirmation email to the customer

If you want the customer to receive a copy of their order, follow these additional steps:

1. **Create a second EmailJS template** (e.g. `template_order_confirmation`).  Set its **To Email** field to `{{to_email}}` so that the recipient is determined dynamically.  You can reuse the same body and subject as your main template or create a separate design.
2. **Note the new template‚Äôs ID** and assign it to `EMAILJS_CONFIRM_TEMPLATE_ID` in `script.js`.
3. **In the checkout form**, customers can enter their email address.  When they submit the order, the script will call `emailjs.send()` to send the confirmation email to whatever address they provided.  If the field is left blank, no confirmation is sent.
4. **Your own email** (set in the first template‚Äôs **To Email** field) will still receive the order notification every time.

EmailJS handles the encoding correctly, so names containing Norwegian letters like `√Ü`, `√ò` and `√Ö` will be transmitted without corruption.

## Multi‚Äëlingual user interface

The site supports both Norwegian (`no`) and English (`en`).  When a visitor loads the page, it attempts to detect their preferred language based on the browser‚Äôs locale (if it starts with `no` or `nb`, Norwegian is selected; otherwise English is used).  Users can change language at any time using the drop‚Äëdown in the header.  Translation strings live in `script.js` and can be modified or extended as needed.

## QR code and payments

The QR code image is displayed on the confirmation screen after the customer clicks **Place Order** and the order summary is shown.  The static site does not automatically verify payment; it relies on you receiving the order notification email and checking your Vipps app.  Provide a direct image URL to your own Vipps QR code if you wish to replace the placeholder.

If you run into any issues deploying or extending this site, feel free to adjust the HTML/JavaScript to suit your needs.  The code is deliberately simple so that you can customise it without a complex build process.
